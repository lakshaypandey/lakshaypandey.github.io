_* Please excuse me if the thoughts don’t seem coherent, they were messed up in my mind to and clearing them up was too much effort._

This whole idea was already on my mind from long but the recent Champion’s League Final just brought it up again.

Actually not the UCL final, it were the reactions after it. Even though I agree that Barcelona were the superior team there I have a problem with their being compared to one of the best ever sides. I think they have a lot to prove before that.

The things that support this are they have won almost all the trophies there are to play, they play some of the most beautiful football there is to play, they have some of the best players in the world in fact I think 8 of their first 11 can claim to be one of the best in their positions (I exclude Eric Abidal, Pedro and Valdes, just my view). They also have a coach who understands their mentality and theirs is the brand of Football that just about drove Spain to Euro and World Cup Glories.

(Add things people if I have missed something)

I agree to almost all of the things said here but I have a problem with people calling them one of the best sides there ever was.

Well firstly I want to point out winning the La Liga might not be the easiest thing to do but you have to agree it isn’t the hardest thing to do either. I mean when effectively there is only one team out of the 19 others that can actually compete with you then according to me not winning the 36 other matches is something more noteworthy than winning the league and the losses were against Hercules and Real Sociebad not the most fearsome teams in Europe I would say. You know Arsenal managed an unbeaten season in the EPL where there are at least 3 if not 6-7 teams that can actually give you competition.

Even in Spain they played 5 matches against Real Madrid this Year out of which the record is W2 L1 D2 agreed they have an edge but it isn’t the world beating edge. Now many will point out that they did thrash Madrid in the first clasico of the season but firstly I am not a firm believer in the idea that the scoreline signifies something, it’s only the result that matters according to me.

You see the only point here being is that for any Spanish team to be considered one of the greatest ever the La Liga is certainly never a benchmark.

Now coming to the European competition, Barcelona have certainly been in the best of forms, 3 trophies in 6 years but again here we are not really considering the 2006 victory as that was a very different team that played for Barcelona then, then main focus here is the 2009 and the 2011 campaign. Here also we must remember that Mourinho in between all his ramblings did have some noteworthy points after the first leg in the UCL. He did remind me of _Mad Eye Moody _from Harry Potter in that interview, just because he rambles every time this one time when he actually had a point  people ignored him. This season for Barcelona in the UCL I would not even try to talk about their Group Stage, the other members of the Group being, FC Copenhagen, Rubin Kazan and Pananthinaikos (hope I got the spelling right) here we can all agree that the biggest challenge that the Barcelona players could have faced was trying to point out their opposition teams on the map rather than the football. The knock-out rounds also only had 4 matches to note as we can safely say that Shaktar Donetsk though spectacular are not that big a force yet. In the Four matches Barcelona results say W2 D1 L1 and if you ask me until the referee had committed the hara-kiri Arsenal were well set to knock Barcelona out (My view). Also in Semi Final, you might not agree with Mourinho but you just can’t deny the overt theatrics of Busquet, Alves and Pedro. Also Pepe’s sending off has to be up there with Van Persie’s. As for the beautiful game Madrid had effectively killed it for that match(you just can’t deny it, the exact postion that Messi made that for the first goal is where Pepe would have been standing to stop him).

The final is a different story altogether. They completely outplayed Manchester United and they were simply spectacular. But does this make them the best side ever. I am a Liverpool fan myself but even I agree that Ferguson is one of the best Managers out there but this final is something he would like to forget at the earliest. I mean the tactics that he played, anybody and everybody who follows soccer could have guessed them, so then do you expect Barca to be stupid. He played a completely English 4-4-2 but didn’t use the highly physical English Game and the first 2 goals were simply defensive mistakes. There is a limit to being sporting and you just can’t use that as a Shield to hide that you were very bad on that day. This when Rooney showed that you can beat Barca’s defence.

People also have a habit of pointing out that Barcelona’s dominance by pointing to the Possession %age and the Shots on target but seriously even you wouldn’t believe your point. Who cares you if you keep the ball, Spain in their first match of last year’s World Cup dominated the whole affair against Switzerland but did they win, I don’t think so. Barcelona dominated possession against Inter last year but you get the point now.

In the midst of all this I do not want to say that they are not that good, you have to be stupid to think that they are a truly spectacular side with one of the best players ever to play on that pitch. But I have a problem with you equating them to sides like the legendary Real Madrid of Di Stefano and Puskas or the total football side of Cryuff.  5 European Cups in 5 years is what makes you the best ever.

Similarly AC Milan had 3 finals in 5 years and if not for 11 Reds they would have had 3 European Cups. But do we consider them to be the greatest ever no we don’t and let’s not point out the Serie A results here we have to remember the whole match fixing saga.

Another thing I have against Barcelona is their glaring Lack of Depth, I mean it took one whole European Football season + a whole World Cup Campaign to get Xavi injured now either Xavi is Superman or the La Liga is a joke. I do really want to see this side play in the high physical tempo of the English game and then compete on all fronts with this squad.  I also want to see Barcelona play in a league where there are atleast 10 matches where you will see good completion and not just 2, a league where the difference in GD of 2 and 3 is not 49, where 2 and 3 are not separated by 21 points but where 21 points seperates 1 and 6 and a goal difference of 49 seperates 1 and 15.

To sum up my point they are good even better than that but not the best ever. They need  to prove a lot before that, Arsenal, Liverpool, Inter Milan, Manchester United, Real Madrid have all shown us recent years that they can be beaten as any other side and had the pressure not gotten to Ferguson we might have seen a different result altogether.

Ps : I know it is all messed up but correct me if I am wrong.

Pps : yes I do support Real a bit, but just a bit.

Ppps : I know Liverpool have had a bad 2 years but remember before that second in the league and 2 UCL finals in 3 years is no mean feat and we will be back next year YNWA !
