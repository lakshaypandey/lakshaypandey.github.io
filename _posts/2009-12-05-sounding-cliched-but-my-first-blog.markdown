**_Well ...._**

My first blog is here. The thing is I have made fun of each and everyone of my friends who has a blog and starting one of my own gives them license to go after me.

To be completely honest I did not start this blog due to any beautiful sounding reason but due to a bet with my brother who says I do not have the patience to maintain a blog for more than 6-9 months.Now any of my friends reading this will agree with him but I warn you that I will prove you wrong.

Enough about the overview about the blog , now something about me.

I am **_Lakshay Pandey_**,18 and a student at the **_Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology_** New Delhi (**_IIITD_** for short).I am a fun loving and very realistic person.(Some of my friends describe me as too logical and materialistic)but i do tend to disagree. Any way this blog is only a way for me to exchange my experiencesÂ  with the world.

And to sign of , hope that anybody reading this page does not feelthe same as i do after reading Discrete Maths.
