My New blog post is stupid. I was seriously so out of content with a deadline to fulfil that I came up with this amazing blog idea. You see my idea was to keep you engaged without making any sense.

Now you must be thinking that what stupid crap is this and you are sure this can never happen that you read this whole idiotic page but bear with me. Have faith in my idea that there must be something I have written that can make this happen. (Read on Please! Just trust me!)

You see we will start with why this post is important. This blog is born as a result of a bet and the complex rules of maintainence (Did I spell it right  ??? I don’t think so, but I don’t know the correct spelling either ! )state that I must have a post before this weekend. So you see the deadline. And since nothing exciting has happened in college so there is no cool thing to write about.

A few things have happened. Like the IIIT football tournament and some Chirag dialogues.

The IIIT tournament we wont talk about because I wasn’t playing. And the Chirag dialogues.....

Well the most famous being : “Tu geela paani laya hai kya ?”( For all you non – desis out there , this means : “Have you brought wet water ” (I know it doesn’t make sense but that’s the point)).

Now coming back to this senseless post. You see I did think a lot on this problem.( The problem being how to keep you occupied.) Well a few ideas were :



	
  * Starting the college thing again. (but there wasn’t anything interesting)

	
  * Insulting somebody else. (but then somebody might get offended and I might have to write a clarification post (which is just too much effort))

	
  * Or just write some book reviews. (which being honest nobody reads)


So I came up with this ingenious idea where as you have seen I have written crap for a page and you have read the whole post. (I am good at this stuff ain’t I ???)

Well thanks for bearing with me and if you feel cheated here and wan’t these 10 minutes of your life back ; I am sorry man but you did make a mistake.

Cheers !
