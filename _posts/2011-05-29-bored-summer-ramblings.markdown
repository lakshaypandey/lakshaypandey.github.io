_*So Second year of college is over and now a face a long and free summer, hence the ramblings._

You know how in school when the summer holidays seemed short and they used to be 2 months when I was in primary school and by the time I came to high school they were only 5 weeks long. And don’t forget the Holiday Homework. I hated that the most in the world; you get ever decreasing holidays and ever increasing homework bloody hell to that. Now cut to college and I have 8 working months in a year divided over 2 semesters and 1 month off in the winter and 3 months off in the summer. These 3 months are completely free with no work whatsoever, now had you given me this opportunity a few years back in school I would have mistaken you for God, heck not mistaken you would be my God but surprisingly it does not seem all that fun anymore.




What the hell happened to me in 2 years, well I can guarantee that there was no head injury or accident. I have my own theories about this but I don’t know how correct they will be.  You know for the vacations to be fun you need others also to have vacations otherwise they just turn in to long sleep+facebook fests.




Also I have been actively trying to find work over the summer and even that has gone weird. I got accepted at 3 different places and left one selected the other and still waiting on the third. The one that I accepted (with my luck) has started in the slowest way possible and I am basically workless at least till the end of June. I have even tried giving myself away as free labour but even that couldn’t land me some work. (That sentence didn’t sound right, did it?) It is hard to believe I am now looking for work when I can lay around and laze all day long for three complete months, my college has brainwashed me I think and it SUCKS!




On top of this my school friends have exams and my college friends are freakishly busy idiots and I haven’t been out a single day although I have had vacations for a month now, sad story mine.(to top that I couldn’t catch either the IPL Final nor the Champion’s League Final, SHIT SHIT Bloody SHIT !) Heck I now feel that asking some girl out would have been easier than getting my friends to go for a movie and that when they also have completely workless vacations for 3 months, those bloody idiots. And nowadays even the TV shows that I watch are on Season Break. Though I started watching [Game of Thrones](http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html) based on a book series called [A song of Ice and Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire)  cool show as well as [The Borgias](http://www.sho.com/site/borgias/home.sho) they seem fine till now but not too great either.  (Suggest some good ones that I might start now, I have seen Scrubs, HIMYM, The Big Bang Theory, Friends, House hopefully a good comedy series.)




Even this post is a result of not having anything to do. Though my vacations are usually good for the health of my blog.  :D




Atleast I am going  home for 2 weeks and might just roam around Kerala, that should be Fun, God’s own Country Baby. (I curiously want to check out the backwaters they seem SICK (the cool word for Superb) on television).




PS : I don’t think this post makes sense, does it to you ?




PPS: My college friends are bloody idiots, and they SUCK !




PPS: Heard this great song on the Scrubs Soundtrack and the tune just suits the lazy summer.

PPPS: If you are reading this and you are free and in Delhi or NCR except during(5th  June to 15th June) and would like to watch a movie please do tell me I am that desperate.
