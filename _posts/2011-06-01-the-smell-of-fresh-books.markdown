I just recently got an email saying, but an eBook reader on discount. It seems Barnes and Noble is selling the Nook at a much discounted rate before, which is now basically about Rs.5000. This just to clear stocks before they come out with their new color version of it.

I have been toying with the idea of buying an eBook reader for about 18 months now. Every time I decide that I am going to buy one, somebody tells me something which makes me change my decision. Now the thing is that I now feel that at the bottom of my heart I just don’t want to. The thing is first of all they are expensive, for the price of an eBook reader; I can buy quite a few books.

Besides all this the major reason is that I have now been a vociferous reader (Yeah you got me, I just love to show off my vocabulary!) for at least 10 years and the one thing I can tell you that an eBook in whatever format or device just can’t beat the love of holding the book.

There are so many things that a book has which you just can’t replicate in a device. The feel of turning pages, being able to see a shelf just filled with books (you have got to agree seeing a folder full of eBooks on a pc is nothing compared to the joy of seeing a shelf fool of books in front of you, it’s just so damn beautiful.) not having to charge a book, being able to take it with you to your bed and not being concerned with it falling off in the night but the biggest and the best thing is the smell.

An eBook reader can have all the features in the world, hell even if it read my mind, the smell of a new book is more tempting than any feature you put in to an E-Book Reader.(Wouldn’t it  be an amazing business idea to add something like a perfume add-on for a kindle or a Nook that gave the smell of fresh book, now that would sell).

Let me tell you the feeling of holding the book in my hand and the smell of fresh paper is the only thing that’s stopping me from buying an EBook reader. It sure does have its advantages, less cumbersome, easier to manage one small device than maintaining a whole collection of books and if you love the environment then the save paper thing might appeal to you but then the battery and electricity and the plastics will balance it out.

Just to conclude you just can’t beat the feeling of holding an actual book in your hand and getting lost in its world so screw all those stupid devices and get back the bookstores with their coffee tables.

Ps: This is me in my anti EBook Reader Phase, that might soon change and I might have a post opposing this one heck I might even buy one so do excuse me for being a hypocrite ! :D

PPS: comment if you love actual real life paper books.

PPS:  Do tell me if you know a book store in Delhi that serves good coffee too !
