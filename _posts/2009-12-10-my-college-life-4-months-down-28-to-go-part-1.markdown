Ok......

every body from clg who can write worth a damn n even those who cannot(who have a freakin useless thing called a blog) have written about this. So, I thought why should I be left behind.[![](http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/atgaaacr6q0yqufno32v1kyfyblo1zuuumi4jab6jbmodtpnbqvzmsv3juxrlihwsnvteunoohw2aqzue5rkwmv2i1t4ajtu9vdrdzp5c5dgasazonrkvvccnkx5fw.jpg)](http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/atgaaacr6q0yqufno32v1kyfyblo1zuuumi4jab6jbmodtpnbqvzmsv3juxrlihwsnvteunoohw2aqzue5rkwmv2i1t4ajtu9vdrdzp5c5dgasazonrkvvccnkx5fw.jpg)

This started as a college that i wouldn't have even dreamed of going to in my worst nightmares ( considering it was some Indraprastha Institute college in Dwarka , who would) and suddenly after the results : was the only college I could get into.

The first day I went to college was _**29th of July 2009**_ ( nvr forget that day ).That day I,as always, arrived late  ( after all the introductions were done, never introduced myself to the class).I remember going to the lab an starting to study that very day (was something about C i guess) but any way even that day when every body was studying I was busy playing Mafia Wars.

The next important thing was moving to the hostel.  Wait.......

the next important thing was the incident with the lab PC's:

This all started after class one day when every body was about to leave.

Our dear SR came into the class very politely told us all that 2 PC's in our computer labs had been formatted and some freshers were responsible for this incident.Ok... I said lets hear it out.Well two of our seniors had lost some important  data about their projects and understandably were very angry.Now , There reason for blaming the freshers was pretty clear and damning:



	
  * firstly since the seniors had never done this before , y do it now ???

	
  * second some senior had seen some guy in the lab who was definitely not a second year student.(this respected senior,anonymous to me too, could not remember the guys face hair or even t-shirt colour but was sure that he wasn't a senior)


I think this was the first time the role of our SR came to the front.Our then SR Mr.A-201(his room number, for privacy reasons) played his part brilliantly under the circumstances and we were finally banned from the lab for 3 days I think.

Now to the hostel part.Let me start by describing the earliest hosteliers.

My immediate neighbours were Mr. A-111 and A.102.ONe from Jaipur and the other from Somewhere.Both of them where pretty cool fun loving guys.

Next to A-111 was was the in hostel geek Mr. A-110 and after him Mr. A-109 the in hostel idiot.(nice combo though).Also there were Mr.A-205(the yoga sleeper,well he does yoga and slept a lot)Mr.A-206 the Stud of our year.Finally Mr.202 the Video Game maniac.

The first week at college was pretty cool, played counter strike in the labs till late night without any studies to worry about (or any grades or assignment).We also had a pool and a TT table .This was also the time I got to know my hostel mates closely.

I got to know that Mr 110 wasn't as bad a geek as I thought could be fun also we both had a common dislike (that helped).But Mr. 109 was an even bigger idiot than I thoughtand Mr.205 when awake could be fun.This was definitely the most fun week I had at college.

but as I have made this too long I will continue my journey in the next part.
