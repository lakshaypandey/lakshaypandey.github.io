*_Fair warning this post is going to be weird. This is like my second semi-serious post. Mostly my argument on a point on which the whole world seems to disagree with me and this gives me a way to throw it out_ *



This is mostly a result of a long sequence of events that are to be left for another post. But for the purposes of this post, I will give you a brief summary, the last 6 months have been  pathetically boring and irritating. Everything has been trying to go _kaput. _



In the midst of this I have been caught up quite a few people wanting to TALK. The talk is called TALK as it usually happens after some major screw-up. Now all of this is fine but the problem arises when the TALK involves arguments or reasons which are full of assumptions about me. Since I am trying to keep this post bias-free I will not mention the fact that those assumptions are usually wrong and completely absurd.  



Now I have made much of a hoola above without actually stating my argument. Well it is very hard to explain it in written word but I will give it my best shot.



Here goes, well the issue is that aside from these 6 months too I have had many arguments with people wherein there are two parts to it. The first being that I am rude to people. The other part of the argument is about whether you really need to say understood stuff.
I will come to each of those arguments one at a time. But before that I will say this, I have no issue with people calling me rude but people who know me and appropriate reasoning for it not any idiot with an opinion.



Now the second argument is the precondition for the first so we will start with it. This has been brewing in my head for a long time now but a very recent talk just reinforced my opinion. People usually have a weird expectation of talking about understood stuff which is beyond me. I mean stuff that is understood is expected to be said and then I am the inconsiderate one. This is not just true with my friends but my family too. I mean I rarely call my parents up and ask them to just talk in fact not rarely more like never( Some part of it also due to me being generally uncomfortable whilst talking on the phone ). Most of my friends find that odd whereas I find randomly calling up my mother/father and then asking them whatsup. The most ridiculous argument to this is not caring about them. You idiotheads, it is my parents I expect them to be comfortable enough with me to call me up and tell me if there is an issue and not need me to call them on the phone to tell them I love them. They already know it and it does not change and so is the case with my “Friends”. I mean all the nicey nice stuff, shouldn’t it be implied. That is why we are friends in the first place. Some of this is also because of me not really getting the hang of so called “_Emotions_”. I like to take them out of the equation and bring stuff down to simpler choices without the randomness that emotional decisions being(Which I don’t really get). Very often than not I try to get conversations away from the confusing emotional aspects to clear rationale decisions and people take that up for me being cold or too rationale. Why in the world would people not want to take the simpler route is beyond me. And this is not a one off case it happens all the time. People are hell bent on over-thinking stuff. 



Now what this leads to is that I come off as rude and impatient to people. And this view is highly endorsed by my friends. The rude part of this is absolutely correct but not the reason for it. None of them can come up with a reason for why something morally wrong that I might have done to them, but all of them will call me rude and inconsiderate. Their reasons for that is me never having those abovementioned conversations but then my point is to people whom I know well enough that shouldn’t be needed now.  Again I am rude and inconsiderate no doubt, but that is to very few people. To the people that I know well enough, I usually know how far can I push them, that allows me to take certain leeway with them. This may come off as inconsiderate I agree but then my argument is why do you have to judge things by how I speak rather than what I do ? I have almost never (to the best of my knowledge) willingly done something wrong to anybody. But even then most people would clarify me as the jerk. This opinion is usually born of the fact that I will be as impolite with people as I know they will tolerate. I will never enquire into stuff about them. But this ignores the fact that I would be the first to value privacy/individual space as well as allowing them the same leeway with me. 



Now it is very hard to make it not sound like a cry-baby post but it more of a question rather than a lashing out. I really don’t mind what people think of me but yeah if it is abundantly clear that quite a few think wrong because of the same reason then sometimes I wonder whether people just don’t like simpler things and it is better to go with the tide?
