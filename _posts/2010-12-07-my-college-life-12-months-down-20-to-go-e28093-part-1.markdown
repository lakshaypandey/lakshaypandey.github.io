[![An important part of your body](http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/liver.jpg)](http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/liver.jpg)

_*Well my Third semester is over; I am a second year student and a sophomore in college. And since my college has given me too much of vacations, I write again.*_

The shift from the second to the third semester wasn’t very clear for me. You see, I had worked through the summer in my college on a project which involved me spending most part of the three months in college. By the end of the three months though there seemed a change; The counselling was held ( free pizza and ice cream !) then the project ended, well it was about to end when I woke up with fever one day.

I wake up in the morning burning with fever and thinking this will go away in hours then I shall go to college, next thing you know the fever is 103F, so I try getting ready to go to the doctor and I faint (one thing I always wanted to experience, not something special though!). This part is alright, then somehow I manage to get up to a doctor, he says it’s nothing, prescribes precautionary tests. The fever doesn’t go and we are looking at dengue.

This is the part that makes sense. Then he also gives you precautionary medicine for malaria and then you lose appetite for a week and finally after two weeks of climaxes and anti-climaxes you are diagnosed with jaundice (well technically it isn’t a disease but who cares!)

Now I can handle most of the things in life without flinching, but believe me the sight of an injection terrorizes me to no limit, I mean I would, if given a choice, consider suffering rather than an injection. Funny story, you see back in 2002 I banged into a glass door (messy stuff, got 84 stitches in all). So I am lying there, all covered in blood and split open in multiple places , in the emergency room of a hospital and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is “_Doc injection mat lagana !_”(For all those who do not understand: “_Doc, do anything but an injection_”). This shows you the level of my injection phobia.

My luck is such that in jaundice you get a blood test every three days. Man I lost more weight due to this than due to the disease.

Long story short, the first month of this semester, I lay in bed all jaundicy( nice word !) and missed out on  a lot. Missed out the orientation of the new batch, missed out on the fresher party and all the sub-stories associated with it!), missed out on making fun of the football match etc. etc.

It was very frustrating, worked through the complete holidays and just when the semester was about to start, I get sick.

Even after that, had a lot of fun this semester.

Quite a few things happened A-109, A-201-A (double room you see, if you follow my blog he is erstwhile Mr. A 110!) birthdays, my birthday, the pool tournament, the cricket tournament and in the end the three sleepless submission nights.

Well more in the next post!

Stay Tuned (Dude if you seriously do, you need some work in life!)

Cheers!
