The last one ended with basically nothing as I had described nothing. All that I said was Delhi was absolutely freezing in January and our college didn’t like happy children all that much.

This semester we had 5 subjects after having successfully proven in the first semester that we couldn’t even handle four. (Funny right? well not to us! :P) We had subjects with absolutely cool names and with no apparent respect for the concentration and understanding of 19 year olds. They were (in no specific order) Theory of Computation , Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Organization , HSS and Systems Management. Well the only good thing about this semester was that you could pass one of the courses based only on the assignments while the rest you couldn’t at all.

Also this semester everybody to seemed to know everybody (at least the ones they wanted to so it was a relatively happy place) Right at the start of the semester saw Sherlock Holmes which I basically found pathetic.( erstwhile Mr. A-110 , erstwhile because we have changed rooms in the Second Year, did find it good but I fail to see how.)

This semester our host college NSIT had 2 fests, one technical and One inter-college.( I thought failed to see the difference as even the technical one had a laser show which was an excuse for about 200 people to dance in a ground ! , but who cares ! )   There was cheap Go-karting in this fest though, one of their best attractions and another novel idea was the Defence stall where the army had some guns on show which you could try out in different poses from Hollywood flicks (sans ammunition of course )

I don’t remember anything much interesting happening in the start of the semester. One or two incidents happened in this semester ( The football tournament and the Fight) but nothing much in the starting . We tried out some different eating places in Dwarka though (mind you Dwarka seems to have a dearth of em ! , South Delhi rocks ol the way !)

Ciao for now will describe the big events in the next post, this one was just to tell everybody that I am alive and kicking.

Cheers !
