_*This is a public notice brought out due to some feedbacks I have gotten from my readers. There seems to be a concern that I do not disguise my characters well enough. Well I would like to ring to your notice that it is my intention to be rude, heartless and other mean things so please do excuse me *_

[![Aor College Logo](http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/iiitd.jpg)](http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/iiitd.jpg)

Well the first week in college did go by pretty well. Now enter the second week and we were subjected to our very first hands on experience of “Life at _IIIT Delhi_” and let me tell you, every one there will make you regret that extra “_I_”.

We got to experience the wondrous joys of _Discrete Maths_ , _Digital Circuits_. Wonderful subjects with great faculty. You wouldn’t believe the extra dimension they brought to my thinking about life as software programmer.

.......Who am I kidding.......
They were one and a half hours of absolute torture. Couldn’t understand a thing and the assignments reminded of IIT preparation papers once again.

Right now I would also like to introduce some new hostellers. There is also Mr. A-113 and AKN (who would later go on to become Mr. A-212). Now to give brief introductions Mr. A -113 in his words is Sachin or the next (can’t remember exactly). AKN is like a new age technocrat who will change the world through his blog.( In his words he is like this individual who has his own ideas and thoughts ,even in AOE , but I think he is a pervert at heart who is absolutely straight).Also to be mentioned is Mr. A-211 whom I forgot in the previous blog(sorry). He is a crazy MANUTD fan who also loves Salman Khan.(he has an aversion to calling Manchester United MANU who also thinks Steven Gerrard is not an excellent player)
Now to move on. The next important thing I can think of is Mr 110, the geek trying to play football and breaking his leg on his professional debut. (Actually only a Freshers vs Seniors match, which had 25+ players,). This day is special not because of any sadistic reasons but because not only did Mr  110_ ,the idiot,_ make me miss “Shahi Paneer” in the mess(only decent thing I like) but also made me go walk in a crazy downpour to go pick him up from the hospital ,when absolutely wet to the bone I was. But I did use this as a bargaining tool with him for quite a lot so it does make us even I think but WTF it is my blog.

Well Mr.A-110 also has another interesting habit. He is like this guy who goes to bed at 11:00 pm when the normal sleeping time in the hostel is around 1:00 am. He also is a true to heart geek who can’t sleep if he doesn’t study every day. This is all fine but the interesting part is asking him about his habits. He says that when does he go to sleep early , he does hang out with us and that he never studied in school but does now because he likes the subject. Dude give us a break you don’t turn a geek in college you have to be a geek at heart if you are a geek in college. And also if you are a geek at least be good at it.( He is beaten in every aspect by Mr. 201)

Moving on, the next specimen for this blog is Mr. A-111 my neighbour. Well what to say. In his thoughts he is this real funny guy, who is also very athletic and sporty and tries his hand at every sport. Well to be true he is this real plump guy who can only crack jokes which in some way or the other has to be related to somebody’s private parts. (He is actually not that bad, but it is my blog so what I say goes,)He sucks at some sports as we have very often told him but he doesn’t seem to understand. And he also had a secret crush for Mr. 205 earlier. (Remember we are in a boy’s hostel)

Lastly the only incident I can think of is also related to Mr. A-110. This is him returning from some party late at night (around 11:00 pm) in a very funny state. To describe this state : In this state he wanted to do a sprint late at night at 11:00pm.The dude also got bitten by an ant which haunted him all the way. He also enjoyed feeling mother earth very closely that night. (To those of you who didn’t understand this last incident, don’t worry.This is sort of a personal joke in the hostel )

To end I would like to say as I said earlier : “I got to know that Mr 110 wasn't as bad a geek as I thought could be fun also”. I think this post will prove my point.Also Mr A-111 is alright at playing table-tennis but even there can improve.
