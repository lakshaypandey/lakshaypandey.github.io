    My college at night !


_*My Second semester has ended! I passed so I am a second year student now! This was the first step towards passing my B Tech in 4 years and has been partially successful!*_

Well, the first year has been good. Not exactly how I had planned. (But you can’t actually plan life like Hollywood movies can you!) Even then, I have successfully passed the first year in a place where they have asked 1/6th of the Batch of 2009 to repeat the year, so it’s got to count for something I guess.

Let’s see.... The Semester started in January after a month long break. Everybody was shit bored with nothing to do in the holidays and realized, that the college wasn’t that bad and also everybody had realized (after the disaster the first sem was) that the selection process here was worse than Darwinian as at least in that everybody got to decide what the best was, here the benchmark for the best is decided by others.

Haven’t got much to tell for January as was on leave for a week (after a month long vacation that is, but what the hell, was not that hardworking anyway!) Well basically the same old crap that   “_we told you to study hard you didn’t, that’s why your first semester was a disaster!” _And getting to know that we had 5 courses now (we couldn’t pass in 4 months and they pile on one more!) The first month is usually the same, everybody is charged up and ready to go, with a dream (hallucination basically, but I am polite) of showing the system that they can beat it but from 19 years of experience, if you had the capability to beat the system, you wouldn’t be in this college. Any way the good thing about a short semester is that they help you get rid of these in no time.

Another thing about this semester was the mind numbing cold in Delhi. To somebody living in freaking Antarctica or the North Pole (Green land also, but you get the idea!) that may be bloody summer, but all I remember was getting ready for the classes at 8:00am with having to brush your teeth with water so cold that your might freeze and break. (I still don’t get how NSIT can have three fests in a year, such a huge campus but forget to install geysers in the hostel)  Also to point out is a night with Mr. 212 and 102 when coming back from the lab at 12:00 am the fog was so dense that when you clicked a picture you could actually see the mists swirling !(here’s the link if you  want to check it out : [http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=3423186&l=3cd636cfc4&id=596319479](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=3423186&l=3cd636cfc4&id=596319479) ) Bloody torture I tell you. Get up early for a class at 8, get yourself frozen while getting ready and then step out to blood chilling wind and all this to sit on your arse and get bored.

Typically the everyday start to anything new with loads of worthless and stupid enthusiasm, weird ideas and lots of energy ready to be wasted. But that’s what holidays are for.

Hopefully will actually have something to tell you in the next post. This one was just to get the series of the blocks.

Cheers !
