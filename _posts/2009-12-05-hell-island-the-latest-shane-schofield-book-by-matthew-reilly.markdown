Ok any body who has read any of the **_Shane Schofield _**books by **_Matthew Reilly _**(**_Ice Station_**,**_ Area 7 _**and**_ Scarecrow _**)**_ _**would agree that they are some of those few books that can hook you on even with some out of the world story lines, mindless action and half of the heroes team dying within the first 100 pages. The first three were great I agree butÂ **_ Hell Island_** disappoints big time man.

First of all the good things about this book are the good things about the Shane Schofield character.

But the bad things go on and on.Firstly this book is just too short.The amazing thing about the first three was the way in which Scarecrow olways comes back from death , this is not there in Hell Island.

The story simple : Shane Schofield lands for a mission where he has 500 dangerous enemies.He start killing from one end and kills them all.In the end friends turn enemies and he kills them also.

My verdict :

Read it if you want to complete the collection but disappoints after the other three.
