_*Well my Third semester is over; I am a second year student and a sophomore in college. And since my college has given me too much of vacations, I write again.*_

So, my Third semester started a month later than everybody else. But there I turned up in September, 8 kgs lighter in just 20 days (seriously 8kgs in 20 days beat that you _sauna slim belts_ and _VLCC’s_). In the words of Master Yoda from Star Wars: “A_ good weight loss program, screwed up liver is_”. (Ok, those might not have been the exact words but I am sure that’s what he meant.)

My first day in college, my first class and I come to know there is a test tomorrow. (Beat that for a welcome!)Well, needless to say the test sucked (which one doesn’t). Then somebody genius decides to tell me that attendance has been cancelled a week later. (Come on!) A week of classes for no returns, SHIT!

The first week went by in a haze, had to catch up with every one, a lot seemed to have happened especially on the fresher’s night.

To explain that I will have to tell you of three groups let’s call them group A, group B and group C.(ingenious names right !).

Now Group A were the ones who went out in Mr X’s car and performed some _activities_. Group B performed the same activities as Group A in the hostel and Group C waited for Mr. A-201-B who was present in Group A. Now to cut the long story short the **_Great _**Group B got caught, (now loads of stories going around about this in the hostel (more importantly about their stupidity), well since I wasn’t present I wouldn’t comment  ;) ). Earlier some N.S.I.T kids had also been caught performing the same activity (well in a more exuberant manner) this led to the whole checking stupidity.  This led to the checking of all hostel rooms (Mr A-409 had a close shave, all last second clearing and all !). Then Group A returned , Mr A-113(new one) had stuff come out of the wrong end, and Mr. A-201-B(let’s call him donkey now the other name is just too long) had a temporary lack of balance.

So now Group C caught up with donkey and then (in his own words) asked him to go to the Fresher’s Party which (in his own words again) they shouldn’t have due to his lack of balance. Then (their awesome luck) they ran into the hostel’s caretaker, who didn’t find the donkey’s lack of balance normal. Then they reasoned that donkey had partaken in some activities that led to his lack of balance but he isn’t disturbing anybody else and the rest of them Mr. A-201-A (let’s call him baboon) and Mr. A-202-A (let’s call him buffoon) hadn’t done anything. Now in an example of the great Indian Administrative set-up the Caretaker noted down the names of all three and said I shall differentiate between baboon , buffoon and donkey via an _underline._(If you have guessed this is odd and stupid full points man !)

Well what happened next is a story to be told in detailed hence it is something for the next post.

(HAHAHA            )

Cheers!

Ps :  before  I end , I would like to give my sympathies to the lost Bag worth Rs.1300.

(To those who don’t know of just feel sad and I shall explain in the next post.)
