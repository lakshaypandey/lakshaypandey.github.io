Ok I am definitely not a big fan of Chetan Bhagat books I agree, but anybody will agree that his books do become a bit stupid. The first one” 5 point someone” was ok (even though just too farfetched). But this one definitely takes the cake. “_2 states_” is like the bookified script of an 80’s hit movie.

Two people of different states fall in love .Then come the obvious problems: their parents don’t agree, they go back to different states. Now again the obvious follows, they hack up a plan to win over each other’s parents. The boy goes over to Chennai (if you are wondering why, the girl is from Chennai and the boy from Delhi) to win over the girl’s parents.  He tutors his to be brother-in-law for IIT, gets his mother-in-law a stage singing chance (he works in Citibank though) and makes his to be father-in-law a presentation which, for the want of a better word, a STUD in his office. This way he wins his to be in-laws.

Now the girl’s chance.

She goes to New Delhi to win the boy’s parents. She wins them over by saving a marriage which was about to fail due to dowry.
Then all of the families meet up to get to know each other. This fails, the girl overhears a conversation between the boy and his mother in a different context and leaves in anger.

To explain the rest I need to tell you the best part of this book. In this book without giving any names has connected the boy to Hari of ‘_5 Point Someone_’. The author never makes it or calls a sequel or tells you the boy is called Hari (he has another name). But the book is full of references to the boy’s graduation years being the same as in “_5 Point Someone_”.

After the fight in comes the boy’s father. The boy doesn’t talk to his father, hates him from the bottom of his heart (because of his violent nature).But the father comes in now. After the big fight he goes to the girl’s parents and apologises. This saves the marriage and they live happily ever after.
This ends the story.

The only reason, I feel, for the popularity of Chetan Bhagat books is their cost. At 90 bucks his books are not that bad. But they are not very good either. This one is priced for 85 bucks only. This makes the reading experience bearable.
