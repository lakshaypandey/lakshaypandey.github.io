_*This post is also my first in the Being Rude series_. _More are sure to follow._

Well I am sorry to break up the college series but I read something somewhere which forced me to write this blog.

The thing that I read was somebodies blog about getting girls in this country.You have to read this blog (Which is in my blogroll by the way)

and also know the person (VERY TOUGH RIGHT NOW BUT THE GUY PLANS TO DO SOME BREAKTHROUGH RESEARCH WHICH WILL MAKE HIM FAMOUS(something about freakin search)then you can know him)to understand this blog.Well I agree things in our country can get a little tough but man you have check yourself out!

You went romantic after a marathon of F.R.I.E.N.D.S .Well I agree that show was quite funny but man that is a show about a guy who has three divorces n still ends up with his third wife who he loved in the first place(not very good at this stuff I would say).Then there is a guy who breaks up with one girl numerous times through 5 seasons n then ends up marriang his best friends sister( not good at girl thingÂ  we say).Then there is a guy who is good looking and funny and bad at the thinking part( dude I did give the title and you can get what I am saying).

Well that leaves a girl but I doubt you could have learnt asking girls out from her.

All this aside man the problem is you are the kind of guy who would break up with a gal if she used bing search and not google.

Well you are not the problem for right now (will deal with you later). The thing in point is girls in India.

You were wondering how come a girl called a guy in a bar a freak. I agree what a B!+(H she was man , calling an unknown guy who could have been drunk in a place like gurgaon ( a very safe place according to crime statistics ).

but she could have a point you know !

Not that she wasnt stupid .

In the end I can only say that the point of this post was only being rude and this problem is long and complex with an even more complex solution.
