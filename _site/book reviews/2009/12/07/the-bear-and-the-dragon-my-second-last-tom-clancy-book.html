    <p><strong><em><a href="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/400000000000000111738_s41.jpg"><img src="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/400000000000000111738_s41.jpg" alt="" /></a>THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON</em></strong></p>

<p>Finally i finished it .This book was a challenge in every step.</p>

<p>First of all i searched for this book for more than 4 months but couldn’t find it in any of the bookstores near my house. But after months of search found it in the most unlikely of places  : <strong><em>Janpath</em></strong> , and that to second hand for  100 bucks.</p>

<p>Then after i getting my hands on it I was excited like hell to finish it up and started it like it was the last thing i would get to do in my life but alas , was fate against me or what.Well the day i bought it was also the day i ordered my laptop and the week it took to get it delivered i could only finish 200 pages .</p>

<p>But after 2 months of weird circumstances i did finish the freaking book.</p>

<p>And all I can say is that it was worth double the wait.</p>

<p>Only Tom Clancy can make , out  of the world ,unthinkable scenarios seem believable and possible.This is the guy who described a guy wanting to get even with U.S.A , crash a plane into the Capitol Building ( <strong><em>Debt of Honour _**, **_1994</em></strong>) a black American President ( <strong><em>The Teeth of the Tiger</em></strong>,  <strong><em>2003</em></strong>) can you believe it. He is also the guy who wrote the <strong><em>Rainbow Six</em></strong> , <strong><em>1998</em></strong> , the book that started the <strong><em>Rainbow Six</em></strong> series of games.</p>

<p>Now about <strong><em>The Bear and the Dragon _**, it is a typical **_Tom Clancy</em></strong> book. It does start slow (which happens in all tom clancy books ) but once you get through the first half ( which even though not that amazing is good) you won’t be able to leave it. His books do remind you of the Ocean’s movie series which have so many things going on in the starting that you have no idea of the plot but once you understand the scheme of things you are amazed.</p>

<p>This book starts some time after the Executive Orders.Robby Jackson now returns as the Vice President under Jack Ryan and John Clark ,Domingo Chavez return as members of Rainbow.This is also one of the best things about Tom Clancy , the way he has carried his characters right through from <strong><em>Patriot Games. _**Admiral Bart Mancuso also returns as the CINCPAC.Some other characters returning are Alan Gregory, Colonel Bondarenko from the **_Cardinal of the Kremlin</em></strong> most of the characters return from the <strong><em>Executive Orders.</em></strong></p>

<p>This book starts with a foiled assassination attempt on Sergey Golovko , Head of the RSS and then you are told of gold and oil discovery in Siberia that could propel Russia into the 21st century.Then there is the killing of a Vatican Ambassador and a Chinese Baptist Minister in China by a policeman , live on a news channel.This leads to China being placed under trade restrictions similar to the ones on Japan in <strong>_Debt of Honour. _</strong>Now China will not survive with these trade restrictions but cannot accept defeat against the U.S.A. The Chinese Politburo now decides to invade ,the now very weak , Russia ( for the new found gold and oil strike).America now has a mole inside the Chinese politburo(courtesy Chester Nomuri from Debt of Honour ) which tells them of this and they induct Russia into NATO to save them from the attack.Even then China attacks and in comes General Diggs with his tanks to save Russia.</p>

<p>All in all I can say that it is a must read for Clancy fans and for everybody else , read for an amazing story and I bet you will become Clancy fan.</p>
