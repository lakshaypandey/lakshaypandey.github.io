    <p>Ok……</p>

<p>every body from clg who can write worth a damn n even those who cannot(who have a freakin useless thing called a blog) have written about this. So, I thought why should I be left behind.<a href="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/atgaaacr6q0yqufno32v1kyfyblo1zuuumi4jab6jbmodtpnbqvzmsv3juxrlihwsnvteunoohw2aqzue5rkwmv2i1t4ajtu9vdrdzp5c5dgasazonrkvvccnkx5fw.jpg"><img src="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/atgaaacr6q0yqufno32v1kyfyblo1zuuumi4jab6jbmodtpnbqvzmsv3juxrlihwsnvteunoohw2aqzue5rkwmv2i1t4ajtu9vdrdzp5c5dgasazonrkvvccnkx5fw.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This started as a college that i wouldn’t have even dreamed of going to in my worst nightmares ( considering it was some Indraprastha Institute college in Dwarka , who would) and suddenly after the results : was the only college I could get into.</p>

<p>The first day I went to college was <em><strong>29th of July 2009</strong></em> ( nvr forget that day ).That day I,as always, arrived late  ( after all the introductions were done, never introduced myself to the class).I remember going to the lab an starting to study that very day (was something about C i guess) but any way even that day when every body was studying I was busy playing Mafia Wars.</p>

<p>The next important thing was moving to the hostel.  Wait…….</p>

<p>the next important thing was the incident with the lab PC’s:</p>

<p>This all started after class one day when every body was about to leave.</p>

<p>Our dear SR came into the class very politely told us all that 2 PC’s in our computer labs had been formatted and some freshers were responsible for this incident.Ok… I said lets hear it out.Well two of our seniors had lost some important  data about their projects and understandably were very angry.Now , There reason for blaming the freshers was pretty clear and damning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>firstly since the seniors had never done this before , y do it now ???</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>second some senior had seen some guy in the lab who was definitely not a second year student.(this respected senior,anonymous to me too, could not remember the guys face hair or even t-shirt colour but was sure that he wasn’t a senior)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I think this was the first time the role of our SR came to the front.Our then SR Mr.A-201(his room number, for privacy reasons) played his part brilliantly under the circumstances and we were finally banned from the lab for 3 days I think.</p>

<p>Now to the hostel part.Let me start by describing the earliest hosteliers.</p>

<p>My immediate neighbours were Mr. A-111 and A.102.ONe from Jaipur and the other from Somewhere.Both of them where pretty cool fun loving guys.</p>

<p>Next to A-111 was was the in hostel geek Mr. A-110 and after him Mr. A-109 the in hostel idiot.(nice combo though).Also there were Mr.A-205(the yoga sleeper,well he does yoga and slept a lot)Mr.A-206 the Stud of our year.Finally Mr.202 the Video Game maniac.</p>

<p>The first week at college was pretty cool, played counter strike in the labs till late night without any studies to worry about (or any grades or assignment).We also had a pool and a TT table .This was also the time I got to know my hostel mates closely.</p>

<p>I got to know that Mr 110 wasn’t as bad a geek as I thought could be fun also we both had a common dislike (that helped).But Mr. 109 was an even bigger idiot than I thoughtand Mr.205 when awake could be fun.This was definitely the most fun week I had at college.</p>

<p>but as I have made this too long I will continue my journey in the next part.</p>
