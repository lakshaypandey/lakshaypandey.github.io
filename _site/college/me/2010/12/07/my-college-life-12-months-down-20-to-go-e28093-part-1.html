<p><em>*Well my Third semester is over; I am a second year student and a sophomore in college. And since my college has given me too much of vacations, I write again.*</em></p>

<p>The shift from the second to the third semester wasn’t very clear for me. You see, I had worked through the summer in my college on a project which involved me spending most part of the three months in college. By the end of the three months though there seemed a change; The counselling was held ( free pizza and ice cream !) then the project ended, well it was about to end when I woke up with fever one day.</p>

<p>I wake up in the morning burning with fever and thinking this will go away in hours then I shall go to college, next thing you know the fever is 103F, so I try getting ready to go to the doctor and I faint (one thing I always wanted to experience, not something special though!). This part is alright, then somehow I manage to get up to a doctor, he says it’s nothing, prescribes precautionary tests. The fever doesn’t go and we are looking at dengue.</p>

<p>This is the part that makes sense. Then he also gives you precautionary medicine for malaria and then you lose appetite for a week and finally after two weeks of climaxes and anti-climaxes you are diagnosed with jaundice (well technically it isn’t a disease but who cares!)</p>

<p>Now I can handle most of the things in life without flinching, but believe me the sight of an injection terrorizes me to no limit, I mean I would, if given a choice, consider suffering rather than an injection. Funny story, you see back in 2002 I banged into a glass door (messy stuff, got 84 stitches in all). So I am lying there, all covered in blood and split open in multiple places , in the emergency room of a hospital and the first thing that comes out of my mouth is “<em>Doc injection mat lagana !</em>”(For all those who do not understand: “<em>Doc, do anything but an injection</em>”). This shows you the level of my injection phobia.</p>

<p>My luck is such that in jaundice you get a blood test every three days. Man I lost more weight due to this than due to the disease.</p>

<p>Long story short, the first month of this semester, I lay in bed all jaundicy( nice word !) and missed out on  a lot. Missed out the orientation of the new batch, missed out on the fresher party and all the sub-stories associated with it!), missed out on making fun of the football match etc. etc.</p>

<p>It was very frustrating, worked through the complete holidays and just when the semester was about to start, I get sick.</p>

<p>Even after that, had a lot of fun this semester.</p>

<p>Quite a few things happened A-109, A-201-A (double room you see, if you follow my blog he is erstwhile Mr. A 110!) birthdays, my birthday, the pool tournament, the cricket tournament and in the end the three sleepless submission nights.</p>

<p>Well more in the next post!</p>

<p>Stay Tuned (Dude if you seriously do, you need some work in life!)</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
