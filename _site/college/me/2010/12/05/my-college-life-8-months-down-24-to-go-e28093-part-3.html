<p>[caption id=”attachment_107” align=”aligncenter” width=”300” caption=”Players lined up for the tournament !”]<a href="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/15032010220.jpg"><img src="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/15032010220.jpg?w=300" alt="Match ki start" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>So the final thing for the Second semester. Only two good things in this semester, “The Fight” and The “Football” tournament.</p>

<p>Let us start with the fight. Well the parts of it that I know atleast. Well supposedly somebody from our teeny little college fought with somebody from the college which hosts us (very cool right?? Aren’t we the best guests! )</p>

<p>Now you see my hands are tied in explaining this fight (if you can’t figure out the reason, god help you ! All I will say is that I love my limbs!  )</p>

<p>Ok so what everybody saw in this is that we know one evening somebody from our college fought rather “had an altercation” with somebody from our host college N.S.I.T. Well this small altercation led to the other guy calling 60 people to help him in his altercating which led to the display of “Mob Behaviour” by the other altercating students in front of the faculty. (Read that 60 people beat up a guy!)</p>

<p>Now N.S.I.T is a wonderful host but damn do they need a course in common sense. Why do I say this please see below:</p>

<p>•	Close canteen at 10 pm because opening it late might cause a fight. [Tell me who is more likely to cause a fight , Hundreds of hungry frustrated boys cooped up or hundreds of content boys who have access to food.]</p>

<p>•	Drink outside, but campus mein no.[Bloody hypocrites]</p>

<p>•	First month no roaming around after 10 to stop ragging. [Seriously do they take such stupid students]</p>

<p>•	60 students beat up one single student in front of the full faculty, this has to be pondered over but one students drinks period (no hoopla or anything) you take immediate action.</p>

<p>•	Have a race in the hostel or Competition in the fest, let others take part and if they win , it isn’t allowed.[Cry babies]</p>

<p>I have a longer list but please drop in your email id and I shall send it to you.</p>

<p>Now back to the fight.</p>

<p>Well we know some altercating led to some more altercating which led to the “Mob Behaviour”. This required to the wise faculty members of N.S.I.T to ponder over the matter. As I said earlier one drunk student who came and slept in his room forced them to take immediate action, bypassing all their rules.</p>

<p>Now our college also didn’t act like the smarty PhD’s they are also. When 60 people beat up a guy from you college whom do you support? Doesn’t require a PhD does it? Guess they were over qualified for this decision. Then you have your own disciplinary meeting and screw up the guy again, WTF! In the midst of all this I forgot to mention that the poor bloke also lost his Enfield, the beautiful thing was crumpled by 12(not necessarily) angry men.</p>

<p>All this led to the closing of the all night canteen and time restrictions in the campus which sucks. To the bloke from our college, the main character of the story, “yaar hostel ki waat laga di!” By the way this also led to the cancellation of the third place play off of our football tournament. And not to mention there was also his friend with him through all this. (Didn’t wan’t him to feel left out !)</p>

<p>In Suspicious circumstances after this incident led to our college removing their board (the one with their name) which led to a whole lot of stories. We were asked to stay in the hostels and not wander about in the night. This was also the first time I saw my Warden. Another interesting thing, the two main involved people , were asked not to come to college for “security” reasons but I saw more of them in the campus after this than I did earlier. This ends the “Fight” part.</p>

<p>Now the football tournament.</p>

<p>Well the “tournament” was just an excuse to spend some college money and collect trophies for no apparent reason. Now I guess there were four important teams in the tournament and they were (in no particular order) :</p>

<p>•	GPFU(The runners up, didn’t  win cause didn’t take me :P)</p>

<p>•	IIIT hotspurs (The winners , only because I didn’t play :P)</p>

<p>•	6 Pointers( The big team , literally)</p>

<p>•	Red Indians(The screamers  literally)</p>

<p>*_The part where I praise myself take it with a pinch of salt. _</p>

<p>These were the predicted and actual semi-finalists hence the main teams. Some other teams were Ardeleres (NO idea of the spelling) , Kicks F.C ( In football only legs talk), Non-Players, Silent Screamers (In a world of stupid names this takes the cake).  Silent Screamers did manage to win a game with ultra negative tactics and did create some Suspense in the group stages, giving our in house mathematicians to talk about big things like goal difference etc. but they lost their next game so Poof ! went the suspense. There were one or two interesting games in the group stages mainly the group winners’ vs the group runners up but they also went the predicted way.</p>

<p>Now the semi-finals were interesting, each batch played with their own batch so created a whole lot of drama. Quite intense matches with loads of shouting and all. Then their came a break in the tournament. The thing with such a small college is that everything is done on mutual understanding ( Yah right !) So the final was delayed for weeks just cause the teams didn’t want to play ,beat that for laziness. Now even though this had drama, intensity , fighting ( HAHAHAHAHA) the major attraction were the Girl Matches. Trust me when I say I have never seen such a crowd at IIIT for anything, and I mean anything. Every-the-hell-body was there. The poor blokes played in the harsh summer in bloody fading light, no support and the girls turn up to play a game of kick the ball/girl and there everybody is.</p>

<p>To be truthful, all I did in this tournament was turn up for matches and enjoy their free snacks , which were pathetic btw.</p>

<p>Now to end this post, I would like to give you some memorable quotes from the tournament :</p>

<p>•	In Football only Legs talk.</p>

<p>•	Idhar aaio bh<em>**</em>od.</p>

<p>•	*****(name not to be disclosed) ball lani nahin aati kya.</p>

<p>•	A-113 scoring a goal against A-102 and shouting GOAAALLLLLLLLLL  for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>•	The organizers going  : “<em>Yaar please khel lo  !</em>”</p>

<p>•	Last but not the least the cheers (censored) in the girls match.</p>

<p>*<em>In between all this, Sachin Tendulkar scored the first ODI double Century and screwed up our D.S.A exam but who cares, it was screwed up anyway!</em></p>

<p>_ _Cheers all !</p>

<p><em>*Will be back with the next semester soon as I have one whole month with no work at all.</em></p>
