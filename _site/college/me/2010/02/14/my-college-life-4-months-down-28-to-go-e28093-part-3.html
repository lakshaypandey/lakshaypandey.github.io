    <p><em>* Sorry for the delay but was bored of writing worthless shit so took a break.*</em><a href="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/header.jpg"><img src="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/header.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>If you remember , by now we had had our <em>fresher party _and almost all hostellers had arrived , the last to arrive was Mr. 212 , who before this had spent a month in the room of Mr. 211 (he was home for _ramazan</em>), and Mr. 110 had shown his true colours.</p>

<p>This few weeks went by amazingly fast. They were all a blaze of Counter Strike in the night and all sorts of weird things in the day. Then came those cursed Mid-Semesters.</p>

<p>But before them was Mr. 110’s B’day. Well what was so special in this birthday? First of all the dear birthday boy had a foot broken and <strong>( censored due to public interest )</strong>.(supposedly done by a park railing ! OUCH!) Then <strong>**<em>( Again Public Interest )</em></strong><em>**. Ok, now this might seem as an exaggeration, but believe you me I mean it in every literal sense. What happened was Mr. 110 stood near the college parking and said to everybody from our class (I mean every boy) Hi! I am *-</em>…<em>-</em> today is my birthday would you like to come to Subway for a treat. Now when I say everybody I mean people he hadn’t even talked to before. The replies ranged from everything like “Happy Birthday”, “Yes for sure”, “Kyun nahin bhai!”  to the ever famous “haan”.</p>

<p>Well you would be thinking that this 110 did a lot coz till now everything has him involved, but let me tell you that he never did anything everything just happened to him. Another cool thing that happened was Mr. 109. This guy was a riot. Well this guy was so COOL! He did all sorts of amazing things. He bought “kwality walls “ice cream from mother dairy (for all those not living in delhi this is like buying nike shoes in an adidas store).What else ……… well he asked 2 people climbin up stairs : “ Going up guys ?”. Then who can forget the great:  “kahan US ya America?” to the latest “dhai sau ya do sau pachas?”(To all those non hindi speaking people that means 250 or 250!). Amazing guy I say.</p>

<p>Well then came those darn mid Semesters. If the class tests were a disappointment, the Mid Semesters where a disaster. Marks are like gold mines in our college. You get them, you can do everything, you don’t get them then you are banned from everything. Well all I can say is that I was banned. The Mid Semesters told us that you have to study to remain here.</p>

<p>In a good movie story, right about here should come the part where all of us turn into these good guys, study and then beat the system. Well none of it happened. We continued playing Counter Strike in the Night and even started playing Age of Empires in the day.</p>

<p>Lastly during this time Mr. 102 went for an S.S.B interview and conference outed(not exactly sure what it means). But the guy did have an amazing time there (his own words). Also he got to show off his Ping –Pong skills too. Well the thing is he isn’t such a great player but the players at the interview didn’t play so well, so the guy enjoyed being the hero where supposedly the tables were cleared to allow the dude to play.</p>

<p>I will keep this post short and end it here but the season ending part 4 will be up soon.</p>

<p><em>PS: I do think this one could have been a lot better, but forgot some things so did the best I could</em> <em>under the circumstances.</em></p>
