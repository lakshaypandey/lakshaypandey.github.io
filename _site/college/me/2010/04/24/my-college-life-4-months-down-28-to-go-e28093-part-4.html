<p><em>* Well this is my final post describing my first semester. The season ender as they say__!*</em></p>

<p>Now where were we? If I remember correctly by this time Mr. A-109 was bloody famous, Mr. A-102 had come back from the interview (After being sent back that is! (No offence man!)).             Mr A-110 had been at the thick of things and I the writer was still unknown.</p>

<p>Well after the Minors (<em>For all you uneducated people out there, this is a term to describe a series of tests taken in the middle of your perfectly happy-happy semester, which take your morale to an all time low and also make you realize that your hopes of passing are as good as Sunderland winning the English Premier League)</em> in this semester, there were only one or two points of interest.</p>

<p>The first was my Birthday (Happy Birthday to me!) in which my dear friends from college first forced me to give them a treat and then those grateful people gave me a bath in the freezing night of October. They did use very natural ingredients like stones, dirt, mud, water and grass to give me that spa treatment.</p>

<p>Then came Diwali, the supposed festival of lights. All you could hear during the week before diwali were only two sounds every five minutes:</p>

<p>BOOM and BOOM!</p>

<p>One of the time some idiots blew up a bomb right outside our mess and that too when I was having dinner.(Spilled my glass of water , just cause of those douches !) Also somebody put some of them below our classroom, and there were quite a lot of them. I could actually see smoke rising from the windows of our classroom.</p>

<p>After the smoke and blasts of diwali was my birthday. Made special by that afore-mentioned natural spa treatment. (But since they got worse after my birthday and I was only the trial run for others, I am not complaining).</p>

<p>Then moving into November, it was all about grades for some, passing for some others, trying to scrape every possible mark from every possible place and trying to decide their future for the rest. We moved into long weeks of some kind of homework or test or assignment or quiz or trying to beat a deadline to complete a project.</p>

<p>As predicted, we had terrible exams with marks plunging like the World Trade Centre, my project sucked and I failed a course by 0.66 marks. Couldn’t get worse. Well the only good thing about IIITD exams is that they are over before you know it and you have failed even before giving the exams.</p>

<p>Since we had holidays in December and the birthdays of three people lined up, we decide to celebrate our breakthrough performance in exams by a three men joint birthday party. Well not to forget the 3 men were Mr. A-113, Mr. A-102 , Mr. A-212 (a good one at that )</p>

<p>And thus ended my first semester at college. Well  right now even my second semester is about to end and pretty soon I shall be second year student  or else a student who has spent  years in college.(hell lot of a difference here people) The first semester was exciting , fun , adventurous and pathetic.(What a combination !) Hopefully my other semesters are as exciting too !</p>

<p>Now since I have holidays , my posts about the second semester shall be up soon too !</p>
