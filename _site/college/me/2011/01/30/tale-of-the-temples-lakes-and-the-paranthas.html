    <p><em>*This was my first trip with my college friends and needless to say, it was LEGENDARY!*</em></p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_128” align=”aligncenter” width=”300” caption=”The Golden Temple !”]<strong><a href="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/2011-01-08-14-25-09.jpg"><img src="http://scarface09023.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/2011-01-08-14-25-09.jpg?w=300" alt="All of Us at the Golden Temple !" /></a></strong>[/caption]</p>

<p>The seeds of this trip were sown long back by one of the hostellers who hadn’t seen the golden city. The way the people are in our hostel, the idea fizzled out. But finally in the third semester we made a concrete plan to finally have our first trip. Even then the idea was lost by the deliberating crowd at IIIT (Believe me when I say that everything is thought about so much, we put wedding plannings in India to shame).</p>

<p>It was in December 2010 that we finally decided to go and made plans for going in the first week of January. The tickets were bought and the hearts were set. The original Fellowship had 7 people ( would have gone for 9 , but we do not support plagiarism). The date set was 7th January, the first weekend of the fourth semester.</p>

<p>Now let’s cut to the first week of college and all of us were raring to go ( I do make it sound like an adventure , don’t I !). When we lose the first man, let’s call him Loser 1. Dude had recently gotten Chicken Pox and his folks were worried about the dude catching Pneumonia! (WTF! Right?)  Then started his lengthy deliberations with his parents and also grandparents. This lengthy discourse stayed on for like 4 days and in the end he couldn’t come for some godforsaken reason. This happened on the morning of 6th January 2010. Now at 11:00 pm. I get a call from Loser 2 <strong><em>LOSER</em></strong> 2 (the bold letters and the larger font to signify how big an arse he is. Also dude if you are reading this , SCREW YOU !) who couldn’t come because “his Mom talked to his Dad” (I swear That is the exact reason !)</p>

<p>Now we are done with the Losers we now cut to 6:00 pm 7th January when 2 Idiots from our group were still loitering in DC(District Centre, Janakpuri). Finally they arrived at 6:30pm and we left for the station but we came to know that the 8:00pm train was leaving at 10:00pm now.</p>

<p>We reach the station finally at 10:15pm and the train has been postponed to 11:45pm, then the first thing we do is, we spread blankets on the platform and play cards for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>*<em>For got to mention the incident of RD’s phone. You see RD is at a chemist buying headache pills ( _:P</em> ) when somebody pulls the phone out of his pocket, luckily it rings at the exact same time and he catches the guy. ! Listen to the Baap of all excuses (NON Desis Baap = Father) they guy says “Sir, phone baj rha tha, main to aapko utha ke de rha tha ! ” (NON Desis it means, Sir, your phone was ringing and I was just giving it to you!) Funny Right, this was followed by a lengthy discussion between RD and the guy which is not meant for public blogs! *_</p>

<p>By now the train has been postponed to 1:00 am, 8th January. (I forgot to mention, the train is the Chattisgarh Express, and the train Number starts from 8 (about this , if you want the details talk to a friend of mine , for now just know that the trains from number 8 suck !!) and Delhi is Freaking Freezing at this time and Fog all around) Then 3 people, let’s call them LG, SR and RD go out for fresh air leaving me and AN there at the platform. At this time me and AN decide that come what may, we are going to Amritsar and there is no looking back.</p>

<p>When we finally see the train postponed to 2:30 am we realize that taking this train might even result in us missing the return train for 11:55 pm later that day. So we take a cab at 12:30am to Kashmere Gate ISBT and arrive their at 1:00am. (This Cab ride involved RD showing off his NFS skills by reading the Speedometer and other such philosophical words from RD)</p>

<p>We reach to find that there is no Bus for Amritsar, and the nearest bus is too Jalandhar, 2 hours from Amritsar. Dedicated souls that we are we never looked back and took the bus to Jalandhar. Well the bus ride is hard to explain in words, it was a rickety old Roadways bus and the driver could not care less if he had humans or wooden boards in the back. Also it was so cold that you keep yourself in the freezer for like three days straight and you would not come close to that bus ride.</p>

<p>Each one of us had at least 5 layers of clothes and a blanket on top of it, and even then we were freezing our arses off. It was so cold that our feet hurt even though we had socks and shoes on. Believe me if there was a window or door open, even a millimetre anywhere in the bus, you could feel the wind on your face. Add to that there was a fog so dense you could not see anything outside your window and the driver didn’t seem to care less, he drove on without any care in the world also the driver had a unique tendency to accelerate on the bends in the dense fog. (But kudos to him for not crashing the Bus, though there were a few bumps which lifted our arses up by atleast a foot!)</p>

<p>This journey is one which every one of us shall remember for the rest of our lives. All of it, the aching feet, the freezing wind, the jaw shattering bumps and the blinding Fog.</p>

<p>We finally reached Amritsar at 9:00 am the next morning (This also involved a bus journey from Jalandhar to Amritsar which was comparatively uneventful!). Now we got down at Amritsar and there was such a freezing wind out there that it was hard to stand straight out there. But here I would like to say how proud I am of my dad, there was a car waiting for us there, and also a guest room. You would not realize the value of these things, but the condition we were in at that time; it was a gift from the heavens.</p>

<p>The whole day was simply amazing, everything, the Golden Temple, Wagah Border and the food at night. Even the Tandoori Chicken at night was amazing. Also the Burger, the lassi and what not.</p>

<p>But the events of the day are a tale for another day.</p>

<p>We finally landed up at the station at 11:30 pm for the train at 11:55 pm. WE heard at least 10 announcements that stated that our train was on time, but kudos to Indian Railway, the train arrived at like 1:15 am. (You would think that this is not that big a deal, but in that freezing weather and after more than 30 sleepless hours, it was bloody torture! Add to it the stupid announcements stating that the train was on time!) The highlight of this was the Chattisgarh Express (For all those who do pay attention to details, first of all Get a Life , and second , yeah this is the train which was supposed to get us to Amritsar) arriving at 12:45 am. This was more than 20 hours late.</p>

<p>The return journey was also a deathly freezing experience, but by now you do get the picture!</p>

<p>Ps: You could say that, we were bloody stupid going up North in the start of January, but Screw You!</p>

<p>PPs: I love my Dad, without him, the trip would have been a freezing disaster!</p>

<p>Until Next Time People!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>YUSSSS !!</p>

<p>(You won’t get it , it’s a personal joke with AN ,LG, RD, SR )</p>
