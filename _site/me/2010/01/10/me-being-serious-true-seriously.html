<p>*<em>This just might be the only serious thing I try to say through this log. Please bear with me. I also wouldn’t mind all of you to making fun of this but just remember you write anything ever again, I will be on the lookout.</em></p>

<p>This Blog is about something that I have been chided about by everybody from since god knows when. But before I present the conundrum I need to give you some overview about myself.</p>

<p>I have changed school 6 times in 13 years of schooling. Now that has some disadvantages and advantages. The disadvantages are obvious: you make no very close friends, you hate moving just after you have settled down.  But there are quite a few advantages also that nobody realizes. Making New Friends is no more a tedious thing, you do get to know quite a lot of people, no worrying about impression on teachers and lastly you can tolerate any kind of people with a happy smiling face.</p>

<p>These were some of the things that could be classified as advantages and disadvantages. Now it has also given me some traits which I couldn’t classify. After you have changed places and friend groups that often it affects you quite a lot without you realizing it. First thing that comes to mind is that it is quite difficult for me to be influenced by my friends (except for few whom I have known since K.G , with them its different). Now when I am with new friends I change and kind of like adapt to them but I know that if I change friends I will easily change again. But there is very permanent effect of my friends on me.</p>

<p>Now the problem arises that I have become quite objective and realistic. For me to do a thing there has to be some reason to do it and I have to realize it myself. The people around can rarely influence me to do something. But this has its advantages  also because when I do find a reason I do get it done. Then it’s like the only thing I want to do and (with a lack a modesty) do put in a lot of effort in it.</p>

<p>The freaking problem with all this is that quite a lot of people feel that I have to be more human (I am reporting people verbatim), get a heart , go f<strong>k my reason, rot in hell and  stop being so objective you D</strong>* head. Now I have no problem with what people think about me .It affects me in no way. The thing is that now since I am in college this gives me an opportunity to spend 4 years with the same people. Now that might not sound very much to you but to me 4 years is like eternity.</p>

<p>Well my question to everybody who says that to me is I never did anything wrong to them nor hurt them through my behaviour but they still want me to change. You see here comes my reason to do something crap. Well in my defence nobody has ever been ever able to give me any example till date. All everybody ever says is crap like : “you are never wrong in t he complete sense “. By the way I am still trying to decipher that.</p>

<p>Now I have some questions . Why the heck would you want somebody to be sweet to you ? Why should I be caring and loving ? Dude go get yourself a girlfriend for it. Now you call me friend and you want help and then I don’t that’s not right I agree but if you call me a friend why the hell should I change for you man.</p>

<p>There was an interesting question in some editorial I read, it said what would you prefer :</p>

<p><em>You ask somebody for a favour, they agree all the time n then you keep reminding them and they go “ yes for sure why wouldn’t I” but at the exact moment ditch you or somebody who refuses it on your face ?</em></p>

<p>Doesn’t the same apply  everywhere?</p>

<p>Also everybody thinks that I am very quick to anger. Well all I can say is that I can show patience (it comes easily after having to hang out with different kind of people all my life) but there has to be reason to it. I don’t need to be all patient and silent around the people I hang around with everyday(that defeats there purpose of being called close friends).</p>

<p>Well I kind of think of it as a problem with no correct answer. Please tell me what all of you think.</p>
